                <h3>Below is a short time line of Voight life so far:</h3>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>1937 - Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkers,_New_York" target="_blank">Yonkers</a>, New York.</li>
                <li>1955 - graduated from Archbishop Stepinac High School.</li>
                <li>1959 - Received his degree in Geology from University of Notre Dame.</li>
                <li>1960 - Received his second degree in Civil Engineering from University of Notre Dame</li>
                <li>1961 - Earned his Master in Civil Engineering from University of Notre Dame</li>
                <li>1965 - PHD in Geology from Columbia University</li>
                <li>1978 - published the first volume of a treatise on avalanches, titled Rockslides and Avalanches. After the second volume was released in 1980, the work became a benchmark in studying avalanches and other forms of mass movement.</li>
                <li>1980 - Voight sent his full report to the USGS, summarizing his predictions, depicting the failure of the bulge and the collapse of the mountain's north side followed by a violent eruption. After a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope caused that part of the volcano to slide, Mount St. Helens erupted, causing $1.1 billion in damage and killing 57 people.</li>
                <li>1985 - Voight blamed human error for the Armero tragedy in Colombia, where more than 23,000 died from an eruption from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. He stated that while categorically accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions were impossible, unpreparedness for the disaster exacerbated the death toll.</li>
                <li>1986 - Voight visited Nevado del Ruiz responding to concerns from the Colombian government that the northeastern section of the volcano might cave in, causing another eruption. He established a monitoring network of reflectors and used laser ranging to track how the distances to these reflectors changed over time. When one reflector indicated significant movement, and large cracks became visible from the air, Voight contemplated initiating an evacuation, but waited. By March 1986, he realized the widening cracks were caused by the creep, or gradual shifting, of one of the volcano's glaciers, rather than rock movement. After leaving Colombia, Voight compiled the 14-page report "Countdown to Catastrophe" (1988), which analyzed how volcanic hazard management had failed at Armero.</li>
                <li>1996 - Voight's successful prediction that an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption, an eruption from the volcano's flank rather than its summit, attracted the attention of the government of Montserrat in March 1996. Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufrière Hills volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites.</li>

                            <p>The relationship Ω·–α Ω¨ – A = 0 describes the behaviour of materials in terminal stages of failure, where Ω is an observable quantity such as strain, and A and α are empirical constants. Drawing on analogies between failure mechanics and eruption processes at volcanoes, Ω is interpreted in terms of conventional geodetic, seismic or geochemical observations. Manipulation of Ω provides a consistent analytical basis for eruption prediction.</p>
